# vfsauto  

Automation script built with [Browser Automation Studio (BAS)](https://bablosoft.com/shop/BrowserAutomationStudio) to monitor and book visa appointment slots on [VFS Global](https://www.vfsglobal.com) websites. It includes advanced interaction and anti-detection features, as well as optional Telegram notifications.  

## ‚ú® Features  
- Automated checking of VFS Global appointment calendars.  
- Automatic booking when a slot becomes available.  
- Telegram bot notifications ([See here](https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial)).  
- Rotating proxy support.  
- Fingerprint switcher integration ([See here](https://fingerprints.bablosoft.com/)).  
- PerfectCanvas compatibility ([See here](https://wiki.bablosoft.com/doku.php?id=perfectcanvas)).  
- Virtual keyboard automation.  
- Human-like mouse movement and typing simulation.
- Advanced Captcha challenge handling.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements  
- [Browser Automation Studio (BAS)](https://bablosoft.com/shop/BrowserAutomationStudio) installed.  
- The `.xml` project file imported into BAS.  
- Occasional manual project updates if BAS releases a new version (BAS usually prompts to upgrade automatically).  

## üöÄ Usage  
1. Open BAS and import the `vfsauto.xml` file by downloading it or clicking "Open From URL".  
2. Adjust configurations as needed (see below).  
3. Run the project ‚Äî it will check available slots and attempt booking automatically.  

## üîß Configuration (optional but recommended)  
- **Fingerprint Switcher API key** (to improve stealth).  
- **Telegram Bot API** (for push notifications).  
- **Residential proxies** (for reliability).
- **Reccomended partner** (Sponsored Link, only one that doesn't block VFS Global):

</a>

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations  
- While compatible with most VFS Global country-specific sites, some variations require adapting the code.  
- Limited usage with Fingerprint Switcher ‚Äî running multiple instances may cause issues ([See here](https://fp.bablosoft.com/#pricing)).
- Currently lacks full OTP automation for some sites (planned for future refinement).  
- Currently lacks online payement support.
